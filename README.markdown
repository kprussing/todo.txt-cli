`tomdo` a (minimally) Markdown aware `todo.sh`
==============================================

This is my collection of adjustments to the [`todo.sh`][todo.sh] script
by Gina Trapani.  The major difference is I wanted it to be aware of
some basic Markdown.  Specifically, I want to be able to use the
unordered list syntax of Markdown to force a git repository to actually
display a list.

Installation
------------

1.  Clone this branch of the repository
2.  Copy the `todo.cfg` to `$HOME/.todo/config`, `$HOME/todo.cfg`, or
    `$HOME/.todo.cfg`.  Any of the three will work.
3.  Edit the self documented configuration file
4.  Start managing you to dos.
